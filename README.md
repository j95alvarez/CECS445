# 9Lives
This repository is for the 2D side scroller platform game we created for our Software Architecture and Design course. There are two main characters in the game - the antogonist which is supposed to be a dog and the protagonist (the player's character). The dog is chasing the cat and the goal is to last as long as possible while overcoming obstacles. There is a distance tracker on the right side of the screen. If caught by the dog, the Game is Over and you are able to save your score to the GooglePlay store.
